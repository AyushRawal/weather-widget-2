THESE MAY NOT WORK CORRECTLY ANY MORE
PLEASE FILE A BUG REPORT IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES

ALSO, I NEED TO ADD Translations for "Latitude" and "Longtitude"

1)
Copy file po/plasma_applet_org.kde.weatherWidget_en.po

2)
Rename it to plasma_applet_org.kde.weatherWidget_$LANG.po
- where $LANG is desired language, e.g. "pl" (or locale, e.g. "en_GB")

3)
In the copied file:
- change Language accordingly
- be sure to write your name :-) (as Last-Translator and Language-Team)

Thank You for your translations!
