# weather-widget-2
An updated version of the KDE/Plasma Weather Widget by Kotelnik, which works with the new weather API used by met.no.
Basically the XML data supplied by yr.no is obsolete, and is now in JSON format.

This seriously broke the yr.no plugin.

This is an updated version of Kotelnik's plugin, which uses the new JSON API and met.no URI - fixing the broken functionality.
